# Description
A simple aplication in which the basic information of each employee can be observed.

# Request
You have been hired by the Nous company. On your first day of work, you realize that the
company does not have a basic system where you can observe the profile of each
employee. It is your time to shine. The idea is to create a very simple application in which
the basic information of each employee can be observed.

# Requirements
To run the application follow the next steps:

- Clone the repository in your local machine.
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Characteristics
I use Django like the backend framework. Due to time limitations, I decided to use Django templates as the frontend framework.
